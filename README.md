# credit_collection_project

A data warehouse project designed to simulate and analyze **accounts receivable**, **credit exposure**, **aging**, and **default risk**. Built entirely with PostgreSQL and ready for Power BI integration, this project is ideal for portfolio presentation or internal simulations.

---

## Project Goals

- Simulate realistic credit and collections data (invoices, payments, credit limits)
- Enable KPIs and dashboards such as:
  - Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
  - Credit utilization by customer
  - Invoices in default (>90 days overdue)
  - Aging buckets (0‚Äì15, 16‚Äì30, 31‚Äì60, ‚Ä¶)
  - Unsecured receivables
  - Provisioning (PDD)
